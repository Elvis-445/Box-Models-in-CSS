    <h2>Without Border/Margin/Padding</h2>
    <p class="develop1">Pistol Shrimp: This tiny creature can snap its claw so fast that it creates a bubble that collapses with a sonic blast louder than a gunshot. The shockwave can generate temperatures nearly as hot as the sun. </p>
    
    <h2>With Border/Margin/Padding</h2>
    <p class="develop2">Hummingbirds: They are the only birds that can fly backwards. This unique ability helps them maneuver around flowers while feeding. Dolphins: They have been observed using pufferfish to get high.</p>
